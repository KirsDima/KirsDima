## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the **Neural Network Development Repository**! ðŸš€ This repository is dedicated to exploring, designing, and implementing neural network models for various applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
## About the Project

This repository is a growing collection of neural network projects, tools, and experiments. It serves as a hub for sharing ideas, building scalable models, and experimenting with state-of-the-art techniques in AI.

### Goals:
- Build and optimize neural networks for various domains (e.g., NLP, computer vision, time series analysis).
- Experiment with cutting-edge frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX.
- Provide a resource for learning and collaboration in AI development.
